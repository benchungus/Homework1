ยง write a couple of sentences describing the strengths/weaknesses of Python for text processing, in your opinion

When I was using python to program this assignment, I found it very easy to use and read. I also found the availability of functions that cover many use cases very convenient.
However, with larger amounts of data and tasks that require more processing power, Python would not perform as well. Additionally, Python has a slower execution time compared to 
other languages, like Java.


ยง write a couple of sentences describing what you learned in this assignment, or what was a review for you
This was my first assignment using Python. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to use, and how vast the libraries were. Since I often work in object oriented languages,
much of the logic and data structures were things I was already familiar with.
